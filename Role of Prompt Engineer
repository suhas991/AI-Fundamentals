Prompt Engineering

The aim of prompt engineering is to strike a balance between providing sufficient guidance to the model while avoiding overly constraining its creativity and language generation capabilities.

Through careful manipulation of prompts, engineers can shape the behavior of the language model to produce more accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate responses.

Traits for Prompt Engineers include:
- LLM Architecture Knowledge
- Making Ambiguous Problems Clear
- ID Core Principles That Translate Across Scenarios

A prompt engineer understands:

- The industry and product they work with
- Tasks from clients
- The modelâ€™s capabilities and limitations
- Potential data biases
